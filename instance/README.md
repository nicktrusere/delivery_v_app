This is a Voice Agent - for a Delivery Logistics Service App.

1 Building the core software to develop a strong foundation that can later be integrated with the hardware and scaled easily. To mainly focus on open-source tools and cost-effective solutions, minimizes expenses while maintaining flexibility.
Open-Source Libraries:
SpeechRecognition and Vosk for voice input.
pyttsx3 for offline TTS.
Flask or FastAPI for web-based management.
APIs with Free Tiers:
Google Maps API: Free up to 2,500 requests per day.
Google Cloud Text-to-Speech: Free for limited monthly usage.
Cloud Hosting:
Use platforms like Heroku or Vercel for free app hosting during development.

2 Implement the Core AI Features
Voice Recognition:
Use Google Assistant SDK for cloud-based NLP.
For offline options, integrate open-source tools like Vosk.
Example Python Library:
pip install SpeechRecognition
Code snippet:
import speech_recognition as sr

recognizer = sr.Recognizer()
with sr.Microphone() as mic:
print("Listening...")
audio = recognizer.listen(mic)
command = recognizer.recognize_google(audio)
print(f"You said: {command}")
Text-to-Speech:
Use Google Cloud Text-to-Speech API or offline tools like pyttsx3.
WaveNet integration for natural voice output:
pip install google-cloud-texttospeech
Command Parsing:
Implement workflows for commands like:
“Navigate to [address].”
“Show fuel level.”
“What’s the next delivery?” 3. Build Route Optimization Algorithms
Use Google Maps API for navigation:
Directions API for real-time routing.
Example API call:
import googlemaps

gmaps = googlemaps.Client(key='YOUR_API_KEY')
directions = gmaps.directions("New York, NY", "Boston, MA")
print(directions)
Add clustering for deliveries:
Use libraries like OR-Tools for solving routing problems. 4. Develop Fleet Management Platform (Basic Version)
Use Flask or FastAPI to build a lightweight web interface.
Features to include:
Vehicle tracking (real-time location).
Delivery scheduling and updates.
Vehicle diagnostics (fuel level, engine status).
Example Flask setup:
pip install flask
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(**name**)

@app.route('/')
def home():
return "Fleet Management Dashboard"

if **name** == '**main**':
app.run(debug=True) 5. Test Offline LLM Integration
Use Ollama or other tools for running local models:
Install Ollama:
curl -sSf https://ollama.ai/install.sh | bash
Download models like Mistral 7B for lightweight offline NLP.
Test offline vs. online performance for voice commands. 6. Design the System Workflow
Plan the flow of information between the user, AI, and car systems:
User Input: Voice or touchscreen.
AI Processing: Recognize command, analyze intent, and prepare a response.
System Action: Execute navigation, provide diagnostics, or adjust vehicle settings.
Feedback: Verbal confirmation or visual update.
